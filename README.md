# AndroidRoomMVC
This is a simple Note saving application where you can set titles,description and priority of the note and the note will be sorted in order
of the setup of the priority.There are features to add,update ,delete(a note is deleted if you a note title swipe left/write) and also 
delete all note option in the menu.
MVC structure was used to build this app.
We used Android room Library which is equivalent to the sqlite database system.
We also used recycler view and cardview for this application
